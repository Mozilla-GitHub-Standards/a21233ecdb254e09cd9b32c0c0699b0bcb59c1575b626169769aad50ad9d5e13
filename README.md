This is the Dashboard used to track performance of Firefox DevTools.

This website is pure client and do not need any server side component.
So you can use it with any local webserver.

An easy way to spawn one is running:
```
nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer &
```
An then access it via `http://localhost:8000/`.
